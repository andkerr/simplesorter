Sorting Algorithms
==================
Check out some sorting algorithms in your browser (really, look at them go!),
built with vanilla JavaScript.

This a work in progress. Currently, I have implemented the following sorting algorithms:
-   Merge Sort
-   Heap Sort
-   Quick Sort

...and think the following additions could be interesting:
-   tracking the number of comparisons and swaps performed by an algorithm
-   visualizing comparison operations by highlighting columns

To view the app in its current form, head over to [https://andkerr.github.io/simplesorter](https://andkerr.github.io/simplesorter), and sort away!
