Sorting Algorithms
==================
Check out some sorting algorithms in your browser (really, look at them go!),
built with vanilla JavaScript.

This a work in progress. Currently, I have implemented the following sorting algorithms:
-   Merge Sort
-   Heap Sort

It is not yet deployed to a server, and must be run your own machine.
To spin it up, clone the project, install `http-server`, the only dependency __iff__
you already have `npm` installed, and run it from the project's `src/` directory.

```bash
$ npm install -g http-server

$ cd <path-to-project>/src/

$ http-server
```

Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser (`http-server` deploys to this port by
default), and sort away!
